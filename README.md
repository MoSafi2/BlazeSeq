# MojoFastqTrimðŸ”¥
## Experimental 'FASTQ' parser and quality trimmer written in mojo.


**This is a 'proof-of-principle' FASTQ file format parser and quality trimmer.** <br>

 **MojoFastTrimðŸ”¥** is ***8x*** faster than **SeqIO** and achieves similair performance to  rust's **Needletail** in FASTQ parsing. 
 <br> it is on overage within 70% of industry-standard **cutadpt** performancefor FASTQ quality trimming prior to any optimization.

**MojoFastTrimðŸ”¥**  is similair to average python code but using ***struct*** instead of ***class*** and using variable types. <br> There is a lot of room form improvement offered by mojo modern featues including optimized I/O, using SIMD quality windows instead of rolling sums, and  parallerism for record trimming to achieve everybit of performance. <br>

# Benchmarking

**MojoFastTrimðŸ”¥** was benchmarked in two tasks:
* FASTQ record parsing 
* FASTQ quality trimming of both 3Â´ and 5Â´ ends.


FASTQ parsing was done according to [Biofast benchmark](https://github.com/lh3/biofast/tree/) for **SeqIO** (Biopython), the rust parser **Needletail** and **MojoFastTrimðŸ”¥**
