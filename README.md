# MojoFastTrimðŸ”¥
## Experimental 'FASTQ' parser and quality trimmer written in mojo.


**This is a 'proof-of-principle' FASTQ file format parser and quality trimmer.** <br>

Modern Next-generation sequencing (NGS) produces tens or hunderds of GBs of FASTQ files per run which should be first, parsed, and preprocessing before further use.   
```MojoFastTrimðŸ”¥``` is an implementation of a parser and quality trimmer in [mojo](https://docs.modular.com/mojo/). it achieves ***24x*** faster performance than the best-performing python parser ```SeqIO``` and similair performance to  rust's ultra-fast ```Needletail``` in FASTQ parsing. 
it is on overage **2x** faster than the industry-standard ```Cutadapt``` performance for FASTQ quality trimming pior to SIMD optimization.

```MojoFastTrimðŸ”¥``` source code is readable to average python users but using ```struct``` instead of ```class``` and employing variable types. There is a lot of room form improvement using SIMD quality windows instead of rolling sums, and  parallerism for record trimming to achieve everybit of performance and I may implement those progressively as mojo matures. <br>

# Benchmarking
### Setup 
All tests were carried out on a personal PC with Intel core-i7 13700K processor, 32 GB of memory equipped with 2TB NVME hardrive and running Ubuntu 22.04. Mojo 0.6.1, Python 3.12, and Rust 1.75 were used for the tests.
* The snippet provided in the ```needletail_test``` folder was compiled using the command ```cargo build --release``` and ran using the following command ```./target/release/<binary> <path/to/file.fq>```.
* ```Cutadapt``` was run in single-core mode with the following command:  ``` cutadapt <in.fq> -q 20 -j 1 -o out.fq ```

### Benchmarks 

```MojoFastTrimðŸ”¥``` was benchmarked in two tasks:
* FASTQ record parsing, including header verification, tracking total nucleotide and record counts using the ```FastParser``` module.
* FASTQ quality trimming of  3Â´ end using Phred quality scores using the ```FastqParser``` Module.


FASTQ parsing was done according to [Biofast benchmark](https://github.com/lh3/biofast/) for ```SeqIO``` (Biopython), the rust parser ```Needletail``` and ```MojoFastTrimðŸ”¥```  
FASTQ trimming was carried out with minimum Phred quality of ```20```.
